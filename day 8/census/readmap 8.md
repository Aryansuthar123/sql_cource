 * Tuday i learn about the view topic in this i create a view and insert sum value of the table,
and i use the DROP VIEW mthode to drop the table.

 * A view can contain all rows of a table or select rows from a table. A view can be created from one or many tables which depends on the written SQL query to create a view.
